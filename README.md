## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a really simple bot with the idea that it will become more complex and evolve over time. 

## 🎥 Demo / Working <a name = "demo"></a>
Place holder for now

## 🎈 Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, type:
```
!dict word
```
The first part, i.e. "!dict" **is not** case sensitive.

The bot will then give you the Oxford Dictionary (or Urban Dictionary; if the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary) definition of the word as a comment reply.

### Example:

> !dict what is love

**Definition:**

Baby, dont hurt me~
Dont hurt me~ no more.

**Example:**

Dude1: Bruh, what is love?
Dude2: Baby, dont hurt me, dont hurt me- no more!
Dude1: dafuq?

**Source:** https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=what%20is%20love
