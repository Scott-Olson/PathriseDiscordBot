## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a really simple bot with the idea that it will become more complex and evolve over time. 

The core concept is to provide basic leetcode integration to the discord server for people to work on together. 

## 🎥 Demo / Working <a name = "demo"></a>

## 🎈 Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, type:
```
!help
```
The first part, i.e. "!help" **is not** case sensitive.

The bot will list the available commands.


Other Examples
To get an easy leetcode problem, type:
```
!easy
```

### TODO <a name = "todo"></a>

---

- [x] Create and authorize bot framework
- [x] Implement base commands (help, linkedin, welcome message)
- [x] Create structure for leetcode integration
- [ ] ~~Create structure for code templates~~
- [ ] Deploy bot to Heroku
- [ ] Deploy bot to Pathrise Discord server
- [ ] Automate the daily problems
- [ ] Automate the problem skimming to refresh problems if something is added to leetcode.
- [ ] WolframAlpha querry support? (something I saw on another discord)
